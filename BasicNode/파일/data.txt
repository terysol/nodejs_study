I wanna dance, the music's got me going
Ain't nothing that can stop how we move, yeah
Let's break our plans and live just like we're golden
And roll in like we're dancing fools
We don't need to worry
'Cause when we fall, we know how to land
Don't need to talk the talk, just walk the walk tonight
'Cause we don't need permission to dance
